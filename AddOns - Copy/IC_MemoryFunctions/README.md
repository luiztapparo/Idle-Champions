# MemoryFunctions
## Description:
This AddOn displays relevant information from the game. It can be useful for debugging issues in the game. It will update automatically while connected to a BrivGemFarm.

This script consists of 2 parts. A primary and a secondary. This allows for some degree of mix and match customization for reads that are relevant to the user. Currently `IC_MemoryFunctions_Component_Main` is the only primary.

To change which primary/secondary are used, modify the #include lines at the bottom of `IC_MemoryFunctions_Component.ahk`.
